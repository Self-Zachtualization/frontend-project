          "Claude Debussy (1862-1918) composed Clair de Lune, the third movement from the Suite Bergamasque in
          1888 (first published in 1903). It is important to note that with the exception of the poetically
          titled Clair de Lune, suite Bergamasque is created exclusively from Baroque movements. The choice of
          compound triple meter for this movement shows the contrast to the dance movements and helps allow
          Debussy freedom to articulate the music differently." I modeled this sound clip using

          "As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which
          gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier
          brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic
          improvisation. But jazz didn't begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In
          the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy,
          improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent
          styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more
          challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based
          improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds
          and long, linear melodic lines."<br />
