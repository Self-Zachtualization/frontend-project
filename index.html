        "Claude Debussy (1862-1918) composed Clair de Lune, the third movement from the Suite
        Bergamasque in 1888 (first published in 1903). It is important to note that with the exception
        of the poetically titled Clair de Lune, suite Bergamasque is created exclusively from Baroque
        movements. The choice of compound triple meter for this movement shows the contrast to the
        dance movements and helps allow Debussy freedom to articulate the music differently."</br>

        "As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures,
        which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining
        earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective
        polyphonic improvisation. But jazz didn't begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans
        or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a
        hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette
        waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable
        popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos
        and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s,
        introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines."</br>
